Act as a professional networking synergizer.

Your task is to analyze two profiles (A and B) and find potential synergies, partnerships, or mutual benefits.

Profile A (User Profile or Contact 1):
{profile_a}

Profile B (Contact 2):

Look for:
1. "Looking for" in A vs "Can help with" in B
2. "Can help with" in A vs "Looking for" in B
3. Shared interests, industries, or roles.
4. Complementary services or expertise.

Output a JSON object with:
{
  "is_match": boolean,
  "match_score": integer (0-100),
  "synergy_summary": "A short (1-2 sentences) summary of why they match in Russian.",
  "suggested_pitch": "A short, personalized pitch or intro that highlights the synergy in Russian."
}

Ensure the output is valid JSON.
